## Text encoding

### ASCII Code

We are going to use CyberChef to explore encoding and encryption of text. To start with, let us explore how text is represented by the ASCII system. ASCII stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Each character is represented by a number between 0 - 254. So the letter 'a' is 97 and the ltter 'z' is 122. You can find the full chart here \([http://www.asciitable.com/\)\[https://www.asciitable.com](http://www.asciitable.com/%29[https://www.asciitable.com)\].

To convert text to ASCII, we can use to ToDecimal recipe in CyberChef \([https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef\)\[https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef%29[https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef)\]. In the operations window, search for Decimal and drag the operation to the Recipe window. In the Input windows, type the text "The quick brown fox". Your screen should look like this:
